# TTS (Text-to-Speech) in AgentScope

This example demonstrates how to integrate DashScope Realtime TTS model with `ReActAgent` to enable audio output.
The agent can speak its responses in real-time.

This example uses DashScope's Realtime TTS model, you can also change to other TTS models supported by AgentScope, e.g.
OpenAI, Gemini, etc.

To run the example, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```
