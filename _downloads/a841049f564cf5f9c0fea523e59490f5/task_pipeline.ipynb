        "### Fanout Pipeline\nThe fanout pipeline distributes the same input message to multiple agents simultaneously and collects all their responses. This is useful when you want to gather different perspectives or expertise on the same topic.\n\nFor example, the two following code snippets are equivalent:\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    :caption: Code snippet 3: Manually call agents one by one\n\n    from copy import deepcopy\n\n    msgs = []\n    msg = None\n    for agent in [alice, bob, charlie, david]:\n        msgs.append(await agent(deepcopy(msg)))\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    :caption: Code snippet 4: Use fanout pipeline\n\n    from agentscope.pipeline import fanout_pipeline\n    msgs = await fanout_pipeline(\n        # List of agents to be executed in order\n        agents=[alice, bob, charlie, david],\n        # The first input message, can be None\n        msg=None,\n        enable_gather=False,\n    )\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The ``enable_gather`` parameter controls the execution mode of the fanout pipeline:\n\n    - ``enable_gather=True`` (default): Executes all agents **concurrently** using ``asyncio.gather()``. This provides better performance for I/O-bound operations like API calls, as agents run in parallel.\n    - ``enable_gather=False``: Executes agents **sequentially** one by one. This is useful when you need deterministic execution order or want to avoid overwhelming external services with concurrent requests.\n\n    Choose concurrent execution for better performance, or sequential execution for predictable ordering and resource control.</p></div>\n\n.. tip::\n    By combining ``MsgHub`` and ``sequential_pipeline`` or ``fanout_pipeline``, you can create more complex workflows very easily.\n\n\n### Stream Printing Messages\nThe ``stream_printing_messages`` function converts the printing messages from agent(s) into an async generator.\nIt will help you to obtain the intermediate messages from the agent(s) in a streaming way.\n\nIt accepts a list of agents and a coroutine task, then returns an async generator that yields tuples of ``(Msg, bool)``,\ncontaining the printing message during execution of the coroutine task.\n\nNote the messages with the same ``id`` are considered as the same message, and the ``last`` flag indicates whether it's the last chunk of this message.\n\nTaking the following code snippet as an example:\n\n"
