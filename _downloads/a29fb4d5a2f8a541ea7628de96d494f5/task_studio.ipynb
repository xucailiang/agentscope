Feel free to open issues or pull requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope).</p></div>\n\nWe are keeping improving Friday, and currently it integrates the following features in AgentScope:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Feature\n      - Status\n      - Further Reading\n      - Description\n    * - Meta tool\n      - \u2705\n      - `tool`\n      - Group-wise tool management, and allow agent to change equipped tools by itself.\n    * - Agent Hook\n      - \u2705\n      - `hook`\n      - Use hook to forward the printing messages to the frontend.\n    * - Agent Interruption\n      - \u2705\n      - `agent`\n      - Allow use to interrupt the agent's reply process with post-processing.\n    * - Truncated Prompt\n      - \u2705\n      - `prompt`\n      - Support to truncate the prompt with the preset max token limit.\n    * - State & Session Management\n      - \u2705\n      - `state`\n      - Auto state management and session management for agents, maintaining the state between different runs.\n    * - Long-term Memory\n      - \ud83d\udea7\n      - `memory`\n      - Support long-term memory management.\n"
