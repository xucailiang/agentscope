        "\n\n# Multi-Agent Debate\n\nDebate workflow simulates a multi-turn discussion between different agents, mostly several solvers and an aggregator.\nTypically, the solvers generate and exchange their answers, while the aggregator collects and summarizes the answers.\n\nWe implement the examples in `EMNLP 2024`_, where two debater agents will discuss a topic in a fixed order, and express their\narguments based on the previous debate history.\nAt each round a moderator agent will decide whether the correct answer can be obtained in the current iteration.\n"
