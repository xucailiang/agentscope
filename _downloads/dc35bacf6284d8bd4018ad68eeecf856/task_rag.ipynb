This tutorial demonstrates\n\n- how to use the RAG module in AgentScope,\n- how to use **multimodal** RAG,\n- how to integrate the RAG module with the ``ReActAgent`` in\n    - **agentic manner** and\n    - **generic manner**:\n\n.. list-table:: RAG module integration methods\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Integration Manner\n      - Description\n      - Advantages\n      - Disadvantages\n    * - Agentic Manner\n      - The RAG module is integrated with the agent as a tool, and the agent can decide when to retrieve knowledge and the queries to be retrieved.\n      - - The query rewriting and knowledge retrieval are integrated into the ReAct process, which is more flexible,\n        - the agent can rewrite the query based on all the available information,\n        - only retrieve knowledge when necessary.\n      - High requirements for the LLM's reasoning and tool-use capabilities.\n    * - Generic Manner\n      - Retrieve knowledge at the beginning of each reply, and attach the retrieved knowledge to the prompt in a user message.\n      - - Simple, easy to implement,\n        - does not require high reasoning and tool-use capabilities from the LLM.\n      - - Still retrieve knowledge even when not necessary, and\n        - if the retrieval is imperceptible to the user, the waiting time may be longer.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>As an open-source project, AgentScope doesn't insist that developers</p></div>\n use the built-in RAG module. Our target is make the development easier and\n more enjoyable, so integrating other RAG implementations, frameworks, or\n services are welcome and encouraged!\n"
