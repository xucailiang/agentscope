This tutorial demonstrates\n\n- how to use the RAG module in AgentScope,\n- how to use **multimodal** RAG,\n- how to integrate the RAG module with the ``ReActAgent`` in\n    - **agentic manner** and\n    - **generic manner**:\n\n.. list-table:: RAG module integration methods\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Integration Manner\n      - Description\n      - Advantages\n      - Disadvantages\n    * - Agentic Manner\n      - The RAG module is integrated with the agent as a tool, and the agent can decide when to retrieve knowledge and the queries to be retrieved.\n      - - The query rewriting and knowledge retrieval are integrated into the ReAct process, which is more flexible,\n        - the agent can rewrite the query based on all the available information,\n        - only retrieve knowledge when necessary.\n      - High requirements for the LLM's reasoning and tool-use capabilities.\n    * - Generic Manner\n      - Retrieve knowledge at the beginning of each reply, and attach the retrieved knowledge to the prompt in a user message.\n      - - Simple, easy to implement,\n        - does not require high reasoning and tool-use capabilities from the LLM.\n      - - Still retrieve knowledge even when not necessary, and\n        - if the retrieval is imperceptible to the user, the waiting time may be longer.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>As an open-source project, AgentScope doesn't insist that developers</p></div>\n use the built-in RAG module. Our target is make the development easier and\n more enjoyable, so integrating other RAG implementations, frameworks, or\n services are welcome and encouraged!\n"

        "The knowledge base class provides two main methods: ``add_documents`` and\n``retrieve``, which are used to add documents to the knowledge base and\nretrieve relevant documents based on a given query, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the knowledge base class also provides a convenient method\n``retrieve_knowledge``, which wraps the ``retrieve`` method into a tool\nfunction that can be directly registered in the toolkit of an agent.\n\n\n## Customizing RAG Components\nAgentScope supports and encourages developers to customize their own RAG components, including readers, knowledge bases and embedding stores.\nSpecifically, we provide the following base classes for customization:\n\n.. list-table:: RAG Base Classes\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Base Class\n      - Description\n      - Abstract Methods\n    * - ``ReaderBase``\n      - The base class for all readers.\n      - ``__call__``\n    * - ``VDBStoreBase``\n      - The base class for embedding stores (vector databases).\n      - | ``add``\n        | ``search``\n        | ``get_client`` (optional)\n        | ``delete`` (optional)\n    * - ``KnowledgeBase``\n      - The base class for knowledge bases.\n      - | ``retrieve``\n        | ``add_documents``\n\n\nThe `get_client` method in the ``VDBStoreBase`` allows developers to access the full functionality of the underlying vector database.\nSo that they can implement more advanced features based on the vector database, e.g. index management, advanced search, etc.\n\n## Integrating with ReActAgent\nNext we demonstrate how to integrate the RAG module with the ``ReActAgent``\nclass in AgentScope in agentic and generic manners.\n\n### Agentic Manner\nIn agentic manner, the ReAct agent is empowered with the ability to decide when to retrieve knowledge and the queries to be retrieved.\nIt's very easy to integrate the RAG module with the ``ReActAgent`` class in AgentScope, just by registering the ``retrieve_knowledge`` method of the knowledge base as a tool,\nand providing a proper description for the tool.\n\n"
