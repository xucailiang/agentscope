Key features include:\n\n- Support **manual plan specification**\n- Comprehensive plan management capabilities:\n   - **Creating, modifying, abandoning, and restoring** plans\n   - **Switching** between multiple plans\n   - **Gracefully handling interruptions** by temporarily suspending plans to address user queries or urgent tasks\n- **Real-time visualization and monitoring** of plan execution\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The current plan module has the following limitations, and we are working on improving them:</p></div>\n\n - The subtasks in a plan must be executed sequentially\n\nSpecifically, the plan module works by\n\n- providing tool functions for plan management\n- inserting hint messages to guide the ReAct agent to complete the plan\n\nThe following figure illustrates how the plan module works with the ReAct agent:\n\n.. figure:: ../../_static/images/plan.png\n    :width: 90%\n    :alt: Plan module\n    :class: bordered-image\n    :align: center\n\n    How the plan module works with the ReAct agent\n"

        "## PlanNotebook\n\nThe `PlanNotebook` class is the core of the plan module, responsible for providing\n\n- plan-related tool functions\n- hint messages to guide the agent to finish the plan\n\nThe `PlanNotebook` class can be instantiated with the following parameters:\n\n.. list-table:: Parameters of the `PlanNotebook` constructor\n  :header-rows: 1\n\n  * - Name\n    - Type\n    - Description\n  * - ``max_subtasks``\n    - ``int | None``\n    - The maximum number of subtasks allowed in a plan, infinite if None\n  * - ``plan_to_hint``\n    - ``Callable[[Plan | None], str | None] | None``\n    - The function to generate hint message based on the current plan. If not provided, a default `DefaultPlanToHint` object will be used.\n  * - ``storage``\n    - ``PlanStorageBase | None``\n    - The plan storage. If not provided, a default in-memory storage will be used.\n\nThe ``plan_to_hint`` callable object is the most important part of the\n`PlanNotebook` class, also serves as the interface for prompt engineering.\nWe have built a default `DefaultPlanToHint` class that can be used directly.\nDevelopers are encouraged to providing their own ``plan_to_hint`` function\nfor better performance.\n\nThe ``storage`` is to store historical plans, allowing agent to\nretrieve and restore historical plans. Developers are encouraged to\nimplement their own plan storage by inheriting the ``PlanStorageBase`` class.\nIf not provided, a default in-memory storage will be used.\n\n.. tip:: The ``PlanStorageBase`` class inherits from the ``StateModule``\n class, so that the plan storage will also be saved and loaded by the\n session management.\n\nThe core attributes and methods of the `PlanNotebook` class are summarized\nas follows:\n\n.. list-table:: Core attributes and methods of the `PlanNotebook` class\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - Type\n     - Name\n     - Description\n   * - attribute\n     - ``current_plan``\n     - The current plan that the agent is executing\n   * -\n     - ``storage``\n     - The storage for historical plans, used for retrieving and restoring historical plans\n   * -\n     - ``plan_to_hint``\n     - A callable object that takes the current plan as input and generates a hint message to guide the agent to finish the plan\n   * - method\n     - ``list_tools``\n     - List all the tool functions provided by the `PlanNotebook` class\n   * -\n     - ``get_current_hint``\n     - Get the hint message for the current plan, which will call the ``plan_to_hint`` function\n   * -\n     - | ``create_plan``,\n       | ``view_subtasks``,\n       | ``revise_current_plan``,\n       | ``update_subtask_state``,\n       | ``finish_subtask``,\n       | ``finish_plan``,\n       | ``view_historical_plans``,\n       | ``recover_historical_plan``\n     - The tool functions that allows the agent to manage the plan and subtasks\n   * -\n     - ``register_plan_change_hook``\n     - Register a hook function that will be called when the plan is changed, used to plan visualization and monitoring\n   * -\n     - ``remove_plan_change_hook``\n     - Remove a registered plan change hook function\n\nThe ``list_tools`` method is a quick way to obtain all tool functions, so that you can register them to the agent's toolkit.\n\n"
