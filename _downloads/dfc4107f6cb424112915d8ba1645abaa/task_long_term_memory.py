Long-Term Memory
========================

In AgentScope, we provide a basic class for long-term memory (``LongTermMemoryBase``) and an implementation based on the `mem0 <https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0>`_ library (``Mem0LongTermMemory``).
Together with the design of ``ReActAgent`` class in :ref:`agent` section, we provide two long-term memory modes:

- ``agent_control``: the agent autonomously manages long-term memory by tool calls, and
- ``static_control``: the developer explicitly controls long-term memory operations.

Developers can also use the ``both`` mode, which activates both memory management modes.

.. hint:: These memory modes are suitable for different usage scenarios. Developers can choose the appropriate mode based on their needs.

Using mem0 Long-Term Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: We provide an example of using mem0 long-term memory in the GitHub repository under the ``examples/long_term_memory/mem0`` directory.
