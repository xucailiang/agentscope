# Contributing to AgentScope

## Welcome! 🎉

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AgentScope! As an open-source project, we warmly welcome and encourage
contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or sharing
ideas, your contributions help make AgentScope better for everyone.

## How to Contribute

To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain the quality of the project, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

### 1. Check Existing Plans and Issues

Before starting your contribution, please review our development roadmap:

- **Check the [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/agentscope-ai/projects/2) page** and **[Issues with `roadmap` label](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3ARoadmap)** to see our planned development tasks.

  - **If a related issue exists** and is marked as unassigned or open:
    - Please comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it
    - This helps avoid duplicate efforts and allows us to coordinate development

  - **If no related issue exists**:
    - Please create a new issue describing your proposed changes or feature
    - Our team will respond promptly to provide feedback and guidance
    - This helps us maintain the project roadmap and coordinate community efforts

### 2. Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This leads to more readable
commit history and enables automatic changelog generation.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `ci:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(models): add support for Claude-3 model
fix(agent): resolve memory leak in ReActAgent
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(formatter): simplify message formatting logic
ci(models): add unit tests for OpenAI integration
```

### 3. Code Development Guidelines

#### a. Pre-commit Checks

Before submitting code, you must run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency:

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Running pre-commit:**
```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Pre-commit will automatically run on git commit after installation
```

#### b. Import Statement Guidelines

AgentScope follows a **lazy import principle** to minimize resource loading:

- **DO**: Import modules only when they are actually used
  ```python
  def some_function():
      import openai
      # Use openai library here
  ```

This approach ensures that `import agentscope` remains lightweight and doesn't load unnecessary dependencies.

#### c. Unit Tests

- All new features must include appropriate unit tests
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting your PR
- Run tests using:
  ```bash
  pytest tests
  ```

#### d. Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for new features
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update the README.md if your changes affect user-facing functionality


## Types of Contributions

### Adding New Chat Models

AgentScope currently supports the following API providers at the chat model level: **OpenAI**, **DashScope**,
**Gemini**, **Anthropic**, and **Ollama**. These APIs are compatible with various service providers including vLLM,
DeepSeek, SGLang, and others.

**⚠️ Important Notice:**

Adding a new chat model is not merely a model-level task. It involves multiple components including:
- Message formatters
- Token counters
- Tools API integration

This is a substantial amount of work. To better focus our efforts on agent capability development and maintenance,
**the official development team currently does not plan to add support for new chat model APIs**. However, when there
is a strong need from the developer community, we will do our best to accommodate these requirements.

**If you wish to contribute a new chat model**, here are the components needed to be compatible with the
existing `ReActAgent` in the repository:

#### Required Components:

1. **Chat Model Class** (under `agentscope.model`):
   ```python
   from agentscope.model import ChatModelBase


   class YourChatModel(ChatModelBase):
       """
       The functionalities that you need to consider include:
       - Tools API integration
       - Both streaming and non-streaming modes (compatible with tools API)
       - tool_choice argument
       - reasoning models
       """
   ```

2. **Formatter Class** (under `agentscope.formatter`):
   ```python
   from agentscope.formatter import FormatterBase

   class YourModelFormatter(FormatterBase):
       """
       Convert `Msg` objects into the format required by your API provider.
       If your API doesn't support multi-agent scenarios (e.g. doesn't support the name field in messages), you need to
       implement two separate formatter classes for chatbot and multi-agent scenarios.
       """
   ```

3. **Token Counter** (under `agentscope.token`, recommended):
   ```python
   from agentscope.token import TokenCounterBase

   class YourTokenCounter(TokenCounterBase):
       """
       Implement token counting logic for your model.
       This is recommended but not strictly required.
       """
   ```

### Adding New Agents

To achieve true modularity, the `agentscope.agent` module currently aims to maintain only the **`ReActAgent`** class
as the core implementation. We ensure all functionalities in this class are **modular, detachable, and composable**.

In AgentScope, we follow an examples-first development workflow: prototype new implementations in the `examples/`
directory, then abstract and modularize the functionality, and finally integrate it into the core library.

For specialized or domain-specific agents, we recommend contributing them to the **`examples/agents`** directory:

```
examples/
└── agents/
    ├── main.py
    ├── README.md  # Explain the agent's purpose and usage
    └── ... # The other scripts
```

### Adding New Examples

We highly encourage contributions of new examples that showcase the capabilities of AgentScope! Your examples help others learn and get inspired.

**📝 About the Examples Directory:**

To maintain code quality and keep the repository accessible for everyone, we've designed the `examples/` directory in the main AgentScope repository to focus on **demonstrating AgentScope's functionalities**. Think of these as educational references and feature showcases that help developers quickly understand what AgentScope can do.

**What makes a great example here:**
- Clearly demonstrates specific AgentScope features or capabilities
- Easy to understand and follow along
- Serves as a learning material or reference implementation
- Focused and concise

**For More Complex Applications:**

Have you built something amazing with AgentScope? Perhaps a more sophisticated, production-ready application? That's fantastic! 🎉

We'd love to see your work in our **[agentscope-samples](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-samples)** repository. This dedicated space is perfect for showcasing complete, real-world applications and sharing your AgentScope-based projects with the community. It's a great way to inspire others and demonstrate the full potential of the AgentScope ecosystem!

**Example Organization:**

Examples in the main repository are organized into subdirectories based on their type:

- `examples/agent/` for specialized agents
- `examples/functionality/` for showcasing specific functionalities of AgentScope
- `examples/game/` for game-related examples
- `examples/evaluation/` for evaluation scripts
- `examples/workflows/` for workflow demonstrations
- `examples/tuner/` for tuning-related examples

An example structure could be:

```
examples/
└── {example_type}/
    └── {example_name}/
        ├── main.py
        ├── README.md  # Explain the example's purpose and usage
        └── ... # The other scripts
```

### Adding New Memory Databases

The memory module in AgentScope currently supports:

- **In-memory storage**: For lightweight, temporary memory needs
- **Relational databases via SQLAlchemy**: For persistent, structured data storage
- **NoSQL databases**: For flexible schema requirements (e.g., Redis)

**⚠️ Important Notice:**

For **relational databases**, we use **SQLAlchemy** as a unified abstraction layer. SQLAlchemy already supports a wide
range of SQL databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and many others.

**Therefore, we do not accept separate implementations for relational databases that are already supported by SQLAlchemy.**
If you need support for a specific relational database, please ensure it works through the existing SQLAlchemy integration.

**If you wish to contribute a new memory database implementation**, please consider:

1. **For relational databases**: Use the existing SQLAlchemy integration.

2. **For NoSQL databases**: If you're adding support for a new NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), please:
   - Implement a new memory class that extends the appropriate base class
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Update documentation accordingly


## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO:

- **Start small**: Begin with small, manageable contributions
- **Communicate early**: Discuss major changes before implementing them
- **Write tests**: Ensure your code is well-tested
- **Document your code**: Help others understand your contributions
- **Follow commit conventions**: Use conventional commit messages
- **Be respectful**: Follow our Code of Conduct
- **Ask questions**: If you're unsure about something, just ask!

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Don't surprise us with big pull requests**: Large, unexpected PRs are difficult to review and may not align with project goals. Always open an issue first to discuss major changes
- **Don't ignore CI failures**: Fix any issues flagged by continuous integration
- **Don't mix concerns**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- **Don't forget to update tests**: Changes in functionality should be reflected in tests
- **Don't break existing APIs**: Maintain backward compatibility when possible, or clearly document breaking changes
- **Don't add unnecessary dependencies**: Keep the core library lightweight
- **Don't bypass the lazy import principle**: This keeps AgentScope fast to import
