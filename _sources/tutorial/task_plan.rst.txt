Plan
=========================

The Plan Module enables agents to formally break down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks and execute them systematically. Key features include:

- Support **manual plan specification**
- Comprehensive plan management capabilities:
   - **Creating, modifying, abandoning, and restoring** plans
   - **Switching** between multiple plans
   - **Gracefully handling interruptions** by temporarily suspending plans to address user queries or urgent tasks
- **Real-time visualization and monitoring** of plan execution

.. note:: The current plan module has the following limitations, and we are working on improving them:

 - The subtasks in a plan must be executed sequentially

Specifically, the plan module works by

- providing tool functions for plan management
- inserting hint messages to guide the ReAct agent to complete the plan

The following figure illustrates how the plan module works with the ReAct agent:

PlanNotebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `PlanNotebook` class is the core of the plan module, responsible for providing

- plan-related tool functions
- hint messages to guide the agent to finish the plan

The `PlanNotebook` class can be instantiated with the following parameters:

.. list-table:: Parameters of the `PlanNotebook` constructor
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Name
    - Type
    - Description
  * - ``max_subtasks``
    - ``int | None``
    - The maximum number of subtasks allowed in a plan, infinite if None
  * - ``plan_to_hint``
    - ``Callable[[Plan | None], str | None] | None``
    - The function to generate hint message based on the current plan. If not provided, a default `DefaultPlanToHint` object will be used.
  * - ``storage``
    - ``PlanStorageBase | None``
    - The plan storage. If not provided, a default in-memory storage will be used.

The ``plan_to_hint`` callable object is the most important part of the
`PlanNotebook` class, also serves as the interface for prompt engineering.
We have built a default `DefaultPlanToHint` class that can be used directly.
Developers are encouraged to providing their own ``plan_to_hint`` function
for better performance.

The ``storage`` is to store historical plans, allowing agent to
retrieve and restore historical plans. Developers are encouraged to
implement their own plan storage by inheriting the ``PlanStorageBase`` class.
If not provided, a default in-memory storage will be used.

.. tip:: The ``PlanStorageBase`` class inherits from the ``StateModule``
 class, so that the plan storage will also be saved and loaded by the
 session management.

The core attributes and methods of the `PlanNotebook` class are summarized
as follows:

.. list-table:: Core attributes and methods of the `PlanNotebook` class
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Name
     - Description
   * - attribute
     - ``current_plan``
     - The current plan that the agent is executing
   * -
     - ``storage``
     - The storage for historical plans, used for retrieving and restoring historical plans
   * -
     - ``plan_to_hint``
     - A callable object that takes the current plan as input and generates a hint message to guide the agent to finish the plan
   * - method
     - ``list_tools``
     - List all the tool functions provided by the `PlanNotebook` class
   * -
     - ``get_current_hint``
     - Get the hint message for the current plan, which will call the ``plan_to_hint`` function
   * -
     - | ``create_plan``,
       | ``view_subtasks``,
       | ``revise_current_plan``,
       | ``update_subtask_state``,
       | ``finish_subtask``,
       | ``finish_plan``,
       | ``view_historical_plans``,
       | ``recover_historical_plan``
     - The tool functions that allows the agent to manage the plan and subtasks
   * -
     - ``register_plan_change_hook``
     - Register a hook function that will be called when the plan is changed, used to plan visualization and monitoring
   * -
     - ``remove_plan_change_hook``
     - Remove a registered plan change hook function

The ``list_tools`` method is a quick way to obtain all tool functions, so that you can register them to the agent's toolkit.

Working with ReActAgent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `ReActAgent` in AgentScope has integrated the plan module by a ``plan_notebook`` parameter in its constructor.
Once provided, the agent will

- be equipped with the plan management tool functions, and
- be inserted with the hint messages at the beginning of each reasoning step

There are two ways to use the plan module with the `ReActAgent`:

- Manual plan specification: Users can manually create a plan by calling the ``create_plan`` tool function, and initialize the `ReActAgent` with the plan notebook.
- Agent-managed plan execution: The agent will create and manage the plan by itself, by calling the plan management tool functions.

Manual Plan Specification
---------------------------------
Manually creating a plan is straightforward by calling the ``create_plan`` tool function.
The following is an example of manually creating a plan to conduct a comprehensive research on the LLM-empowered agent.

    The current hint message:

    user: <system-hint>The current plan:

    # Research on Agent
    **Description**: Conduct a comprehensive research on the LLM-empowered agent.

    - [ ] Search agent-related survey papers
    - [ ] Read and summarize the papers
    - [ ] Research on recent advances of large company
    - [ ] Write a report
    ```
    Your options include:
    - Mark the first subtask as 'in_progress' by calling 'update_subtask_state' with subtask_idx=0 and state='in_progress', and start executing it.
    - If the first subtask is not executable, analyze why and what you can do to advance the plan, e.g. ask user for more information, revise the plan by calling 'revise_current_plan'.
    - If the user asks you to do something unrelated to the plan, prioritize the completion of user's query first, and then return to the plan afterward.
    - If the user no longer wants to perform the current plan, confirm with the user and call the 'finish_plan' function.
    </system-hint>

After creating the plan, you can initialize the `ReActAgent` with the
plan notebook as follows:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-233

.. code-block:: Python


    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        plan_notebook=plan_notebook,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 234-239

Agent-Managed Plan Execution
---------------------------------
Agent can also create and manage the plan by itself, by calling the plan management tool functions.
We just need to initialize the `ReActAgent` with the plan notebook as follows:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 239-251

.. code-block:: Python


    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        plan_notebook=PlanNotebook(),
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 252-282

After that, we can build a loop to interact with the agent as follows.
Once the task is complex, the agent will create a plan by itself and
execute the plan step by step.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Build conversation with the plan agent

    async def interact_with_agent() -> None:
        """Interact with the plan agent."""
        user = UserAgent(name="user")

        msg = None
        while True:
            msg = await user(msg)
            if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
                break
            msg = await agent(msg)

    asyncio.run(interact_with_agent())


Plan Visualization and Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AgentScope supports real-time visualization and monitoring of the plan
execution by the plan change hook function.

They will be triggered when the plan is changed by calling the tool
functions. A template of the plan change hook function is as follows:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 282-294

.. code-block:: Python



    def plan_change_hook_template(self: PlanNotebook, plan: Plan) -> None:
        """A template of the plan change hook function.

        Args:
            self (`PlanNotebook`):
                The PlanNotebook instance.
            plan (`Plan`):
                The current plan instance (after the change).
        """
        # Forward the plan to the frontend for visualization or other processing
